# Unity 3D

We're planning to support [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/) as a first-class development environment for Ruyi.

Refer to the following:

- [Unity sample](https://bitbucket.org/playruyi/space_shooter)
- [Unity tutorial](../tutorials/run_unity_sample_console.md)

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2017.1.1f1 (newer versions likely work)

## Quick Start

RuyiNet is provided as high-level wrapper around the Ruyi C# API.

1. [SDK libraries targetting .Net 3.5](http://dev.playruyi.com/udownloadslist/SDK) should be placed in `Assets/Plugins/x64`
1. Create an instance of RuyiNet script and add your app id/secret:
